Code for finding Nash equilibria in escape interdiction games (EIG) with a double oracle framework.

Oracles include:
* Big-M (Zhang) attacker oracle;
* Big-M (Zhang) defender oracle;
* Network attacker oracle;
* Network defender oracle;

Executing `EIG_Notebook.jl` will run the double oracle on each test-case (given in the folder `Dataset_VNS_CAIE_Paper`) with the oracle pairs:
* Big-M oracles (attacker and defender)
* Network oracles (attacker and defender)
